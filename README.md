E-commerce Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project.

Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive visualization of e-commerce sales data, allowing users to track and analyze key metrics such as profit, sales, customer trends, and category-wise performance.

Key Features
Interactive Data Exploration: Used slicers and filters for enhanced user-driven analysis.
Advanced Calculations: Applied table calculations and joins for data manipulation.
Custom Visualizations: Integrated bar charts, pie charts, and donut charts for better insights.

Step-by-Step Development
1. Data Collection & Preparation
Imported sales data into Power BI from sources like Excel, SQL Server, or CSV files.
Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Power Query for consistency.
Created relationships between tables using joins to enable accurate visual representation.

2. Building the Dashboard Layout
Designed an intuitive dashboard layout with key performance indicators (KPIs) at the top.
Divided sections for state-wise sales, payment mode distribution, monthly profits, and sub-category performance.

3. Implementing Visualizations
Bar Charts: Used for analyzing profit by month, amount by state, and top customers.
Pie & Donut Charts: Visualized sales distribution by category and payment modes.
Slicers & Filters: Added for users to drill down into quarterly or categorical data.

4. Creating Measures & Calculations
Implemented DAX formulas for key metrics such as total profit, average order value, and sum of quantity.
Created calculated columns for segmenting data dynamically.

5. Enhancing Interactivity
Added slicers for filtering data by quarters and overall selection.
Enabled drill-through actions for detailed data exploration.

Technologies Used
Power BI: For visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculated fields and dynamic data representation.
Power Query: For data transformation and modeling.
